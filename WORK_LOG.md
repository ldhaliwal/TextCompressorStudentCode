The idea I have right now seems like it could work logically, but won't be great in terms of run time/efficiency. not sure if I'm going to bother to try to turn it into actual code or try a new approach. |

I did my best with the pseudocode from the slides, and the tried going through the chart of compressing while writing out my code to make sure I wasn't missing a step. |
| December 10 | 5:15-5:45pm  | flushed out a bit of the code and tried running the program on alice.txt. the compress method took so long that I had to control c it to stop and then tried compressing abra, which worked, (but also was larger than the original!?!?) and then when expanding I got a null point exception that I don't totally understand. I tried going through my expand method step by step and clarified some of my variables to hopefully keep things more organized and though I had fixed something but then i ran it again and got the same error. everything is broken and I'm hungry. will return to debug later! |
