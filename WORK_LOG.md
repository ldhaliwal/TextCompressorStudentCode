The idea I have right now seems like it could work logically, but won't be great in terms of run time/efficiency. not sure if I'm going to bother to try to turn it into actual code or try a new approach. |
| December 4 | 10-10;35pm | tried to do a new approach to compressing by just looking for runs of repeated letters, but i tried to run it and ended up with it compressing to 0 bits so no success. ran into some problems trying to get the character representations of number into integers, but i think I kinda solved it? definitely not the most code efficient way of doing it. |
